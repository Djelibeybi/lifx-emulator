# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-10)

**Core value:** A LAN client library can discover and control an emulated Thread device exactly as it would a real one: found only over mDNS with an AAAA record, reachable only by IPv6 unicast, every reply carrying the Thread connection bit.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — mDNS Responder

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — mDNS Responder
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 02 shipped — PR #218
Last activity: 2026-09-11 — Phase 02 PR #218 created; CI and merge pending; Phase 3 ready to plan

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal layers — core identity → IPv6 transport → mDNS → CLI/config → API → verification.
- [Phase 02]: Thread devices accept only exact untagged IPv6 unicast; rejection happens before counters, activity, acknowledgements or processing.
- [Phase 02]: The server atomically publishes a same-port IPv4 plus `AF_INET6`/`V6ONLY` pair, with protocol-owned immutable reply routing and bounded generation-aware shutdown.
- [Phase 02]: Packet and WebSocket bridge capacity is bounded; every admitted unit is retained, while excess work is rejected before allocation and counted in overload metrics.
- [Phase 03]: zeroconf versus a hand-rolled responder remains undecided — the MDNS-10 spike gates the remaining mDNS work.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: mDNS implementation choice is unresolved until the MDNS-10 spike records a go/no-go; the remaining ten mDNS requirements cannot be planned in detail before it
- [Phase 3]: Port 5353 is owned by the host mDNS daemon on macOS and Windows; legacy-unicast replies are the load-bearing path for `lifx-async`
- [Phase 6]: No Windows CI leg — Windows socket-option guards must be covered by simulation tests instead
- [Ship]: Phase 02 PR #218 uses `feat: add IPv6 transport and Thread isolation`; CI and merge remain pending. Phase 01 PR #217 merged on 2026-09-09.
