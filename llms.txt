# LIFX Emulator

> A comprehensive LIFX device emulator for testing LIFX LAN protocol libraries

A comprehensive LIFX device emulator for testing LIFX LAN protocol libraries.

This emulator implements the binary UDP protocol from https://lan.developer.lifx.com
and emulates various LIFX device types including color lights, multizone strips,
tiles, infrared, and HEV devices. It provides a complete testing environment with
persistent storage, HTTP management API, and advanced scenario testing capabilities
for simulating protocol edge cases, packet loss, delays, and malformed responses.
