# LIFX Emulator

> A comprehensive LIFX device emulator for testing LIFX LAN protocol libraries

A comprehensive LIFX device emulator for testing LIFX LAN protocol libraries.

This project provides two packages:
- lifx-emulator: CLI tool and HTTP management API for standalone use
- lifx-emulator-core: Embeddable Python library for integration in your own projects

Both implement the binary UDP protocol from https://lan.developer.lifx.com
and emulate various LIFX device types including color lights, multizone strips,
tiles, infrared, and HEV devices. The emulator provides persistent storage,
HTTP management API, and advanced scenario testing capabilities for simulating
protocol edge cases, packet loss, delays, and malformed responses.
